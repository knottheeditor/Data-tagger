# 📖 Data Forager: The Official Manual (v2.0 Beta)

Welcome to the **Data Forager**—your high-speed, AI-powered content factory. This version includes **Precision Controls** to ensure you can safely organize your largest folders without risk.

---

## 🏗️ 1. The Core Concept

The app works in a **Command & Control** relationship:
- **Local GUI**: Your control center. Browse files and verify details.
- **RunPod Worker**: The "Brain" (RTX 4090). It does the AI tagging and moves files directly in the cloud.
- **S3 Storage**: Your Warehouse (mapped as `Z:\`).

---

## 🎨 2. The Dashboard Layout

### 📍 Left Panel: Discovery & Command

- **INJECT FROM CLOUD**: Type a folder name (e.g., `Content-Archive`) and hit this to scan only that folder.
- **DRY RUN MODE**: **CRITICAL**. Check this to simulate the batch. AI will generate names and metadata but **won't move any files**.
- **COMMAND: START BATCH**: Launches the Pod worker.
- **ABORT CLOUD BATCH**: Instantly kills all processes on the Pod (Emergency Brake).
- **🔄 SYNC CLOUD STATS**: Pulls the latest progress from the Pod back to your local view.

### 📜 Middle Panel: Processing Logs

- Live feed from the cloud. Watch the AI "thinking" and the file transfers happening in real-time.

### 👁️ Right Panel: VLM Preview & Verification

- **PROJECTED DEST**: Shows exactly where the file will end up *before* you process it.
- **VLM Metadata**: Shows tags and descriptions generated by the AI.

## 🚀 3. How to Process a Batch (Step-by-Step)

### Step 1: Power Up

1. **Turn on your RunPod** (the RTX 4090 instance).
2. **Wait for it to boot** (approx. 30 seconds).

### Step 2: Ingest Content

1. **In the GUI, type the folder you want** into the **TARGETED CLOUD SCAN** box (e.g., `Content-Archive`).
2. **Click INJECT FROM CLOUD**. New files will appear in the list as `pending`.

### Step 3: Verify (The "Look Before You Leap")

1. **Click a file in the list**.
2. **Check the PROJECTED DEST** in the right panel. Does the naming look correct based on your standards?

### Step 4: Simulated Flight (Dry Run)

1. **Check the DRY RUN MODE box**.
2. **Click COMMAND: START BATCH**.
3. **Wait a few minutes** as the worker processes the AI analysis.
4. **Click 🔄 SYNC CLOUD STATS**. The files should now show as `dry_run_complete`.

### Step 5: Live Execution

1. **Once you are happy with the Dry Run results, Uncheck DRY RUN MODE**.
2. **Click COMMAND: START BATCH again**.
3. **The worker will now perform the actual S3 movements**.

## 🛡️ 4. Safety Tips

- **Heartbeat**: The Pod auto-kills heavy processes after 30 mins of inactivity to save cost.
- **Abort**: If you see the AI naming things weirdly, hit **ABORT** immediately.
- **Sync**: Always hit **SYNC CLOUD STATS** if the GUI looks "behind" what the logs say.
